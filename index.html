                        ---
                        ## Introduction
                        - My background as a developer is mainly b2b microsites, web apps and online experiences, very little ecommerce
                        - Ecommerce seems particularly difficult to adhere to web standards and best practices
                        ---
                        ## Best Practice: "Keep your site as light as possible"
                        The smaller your site is, the quicker it loads and the better experience your users will have.
                        

                        ## How ecommerce breaks this: Third party scripts everywhere
                        Due to the conversion based nature of ecommerce there is an abundance of tracking and third party offerings on a lot of ecommerce sites which bloats out the page and can make for a slow TTI.
                        

                        ## How can we improve on this?
                        - Audit third party scripts regularly
                        - When integrating third party scripts and tools, run a performance test to see how damaging this will be, as well as potentially A/B testing, if appropriate, to ensure it will actually deliver value even with a more bloated page.
                        ---
                        ## Best Practice: "WCAG AA contrast compliance"
                        A commonly broken WCAG standard is how readable a piece of text is on it's background colour.
                        

                        ## How ecommerce breaks this: Frequent updates and eye catching colours
                        With clients wanting access to choose colours for the site themselves there is always the risk they may select colours without considering WCAG compliance.


                        ## How can we improve on this?
                        - Client education, AA compliance can be quite easy to achieve, even with nice colour combinations
                        - Providing theming options to the client rather than outright colour selection
                        ---
                        ## Best Practice: "Provide the best possible experience for your users"
                        If a user enjoys using your site they are more likely to hang around
                        

                        ## How ecommerce breaks this: Dark patterns
                        In the pursuit of better metrics some sites implement dark patterns to add friction to the users experience. An example of this is making the "Cancel Subscription" button be behind a submenu.


                        ## How can we improve on this?
                        - Be aware of legalities around things like GDPR with some marketing related dark patterns
                        - Some dark patterns are quite benign, others can be much more powerful, each change should be evaluated independantly 
                        ---
                        ## Conclusion
                        Not many websites are adhering to every best practice, but keeping them in mind and striving for them can only make a better end product
